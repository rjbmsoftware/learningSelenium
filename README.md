Project for me to learn selenium framework and page object model using the pulper app from the evil tester.

 - https://www.eviltester.com/page/tools/thepulper/ 
 - https://github.com/eviltester/TestingApp/releases version 1.2.6

There are some peculiarities in that the app does not have users as such it has JSESSIONIDs as way of dividing content

Webdrivers are only included for macOS and Windows you may need to enable on macOS to run an unsigned app (limitation of the current driver).
